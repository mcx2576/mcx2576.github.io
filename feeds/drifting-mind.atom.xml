During the spring festival, I came across the Corona crisis in China. When I came back to Europe, I was advised to quarantine for two weeks. Then it explodes in The Netherlands in mid May, which forces me to stay at home till now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the infinite quarantine period, I have been through the vicious cycle of encountering sth fresh -&amp;gt; being afraid of being infected -&amp;gt; trying everything new -&amp;gt; Getting bored of everything. I experienced with cooking, baking, playing the piano and farming. Sometimes time flies so fast that I didn't realize that I haven been trapped for three months in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that the world could come back to normal soon, though I know the "normal" could never be the life we used to have anyway. The Economics published an article claiming the globalization is dead, while I am more concerned about the fact that I might not be able to travel to different places and experience various lifestyles. At least I could use my blog to voice out what I am thinking about to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
